# Digit-Classification-with-Multiple-Algorithms-and-Hyperparameter-Tuning
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits using various machine learning algorithms. The Digits dataset from sklearn.datasets was used to train models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (Gaussian and Multinomial), and Decision Tree. Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to identify the best parameters and optimize the performance of each model.

# Features:
- Data Loading: The Digits dataset was loaded from sklearn.datasets.
- Model Training:
Implemented classification using SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (Gaussian and Multinomial), and Decision Tree models.
Hyperparameter tuning was applied using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using cross-validation, identifying the best model and optimal hyperparameters.
  
# Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, scikit-learn
